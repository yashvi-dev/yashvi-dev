🚀 About Me

🎓 A third-year B.Tech student eager to explore the cutting-edge world of Web3.

🎶 Fueled by the melodies of The Weeknd and Taylor Swift, I believe music has the power to inspire.

📚 While focused on academic pursuits, I find inspiration in the success stories of women who are shaping the business landscape.

🏎️ Beyond code, I'm an avid Formula 1 fan, cheering passionately for Carlos Sainz. 🎾 I also enjoy the thrill of tennis matches.

🎮 With a knack for selecting the perfect tunes, I'm always ready to curate the soundtrack for any gathering. 🎶
